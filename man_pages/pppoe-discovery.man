PPPOE-DISCOVERY(8)          System Manager's Manual         PPPOE-DISCOVERY(8)

NAME
       pppoe-discovery - perform PPPoE discovery

SYNOPSIS
       pppoe-discovery [ options ]
       pppoe-discovery { -V | -h }

DESCRIPTION
       pppoe-discovery  performs the same discovery process as pppoe, but does
       not initiate a session.  It sends a PADI packet  and  then  prints  the
       names of access concentrators in each PADO packet it receives.

OPTIONS
       -I interface
              The  -I  option  specifies the Ethernet interface to use.  Under
              Linux, it is typically eth0 or eth1.  The  interface  should  be
              “up” before you start pppoe-discovery, but should not be config‐
              ured to have an IP address.  The default interface is eth0.

       -D file_name
              The -D option causes every packet to be dumped to the  specified
              file_name.  This is intended for debugging only.

       -U
              Causes pppoe-discovery to use the Host-Uniq tag in its discovery
              packets. The value of the tag is derived from the process's  PID
              number.  This lets you run multiple instances of pppoe-discovery
              and/or pppd without having  their  discovery  packets  interfere
              with  one another.  You must supply this option to all instances
              that you intend to run simultaneously.  This option is  mutually
              exclusive with -W.

       -W value
              Causes pppoe-discovery to use the Host-Uniq tag in its discovery
              packets. The value of the tag is taken from the option argument,
              encoded  as  a  string of hexadecimal digits.  This lets you run
              multiple instances of pppoe-discovery and/or pppd without having
              their  discovery  packets  interfere with one another.  You must
              supply this option to all instances that you intend to  run  si‐
              multaneously.  This option is mutually exclusive with -U.

       -S service_name
              Specifies  the  desired service name.  pppoe-discovery will only
              accept access concentrators which can provide the specified ser‐
              vice.   In  most cases, you should not specify this option.  Use
              it only if you know that there are multiple access concentrators
              or know that you need a specific service name.

       -C ac_name
              Specifies the desired access concentrator name.  pppoe-discovery
              will only accept the specified  access  concentrator.   In  most
              cases,  you  should not specify this option.  Use it only if you
              know that there are multiple access concentrators.  If both  the
              -S and -C options are specified, they must both match.

       -Q
              Causes  pppoe-discovery to avoid printing discovered access con‐
              centrator names.  This can be useful in scripts, which  can  use
              the  exit  code of the program to determine whether any matching
              access concentrators were discovered.

       -t timeout
              Changes the discovery timeout for  PADI  requests,  in  seconds.
              The default value is 5 seconds.

       -a attempts
              Changes the number of PADI discovery attempts made.  By default,
              3 attempts are made to discover access concentrators before giv‐
              ing up.

       -V | -h
              Either of these options causes pppoe-discovery to print its ver‐
              sion number and usage information, then exit.
