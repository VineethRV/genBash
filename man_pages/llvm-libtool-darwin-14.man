NAME
       llvm-libtool-darwin - LLVM tool for creating libraries for Darwin

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-libtool-darwin [options] <input files>

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-libtool-darwin is a tool for creating static and dynamic libraries
       for Darwin.

       For most scenarios, it works as  a  drop-in  replacement  for  cctools’
       libtool.

OPTIONS
       llvm-libtool-darwin supports the following options:

       -arch_only <architecture>
              Build a static library only for the specified <architecture> and
              ignore all other architectures in the files.

       -color Use colors in output.

       -D     Use zero for timestamps and UIDs/GIDs. This is set by default.

       -filelist <listfile[,dirname]>
              Read input file names from <listfile>. File names are  specified
              in  <listfile>  one per line, separated only by newlines. White‐
              space on a line is assumed to be part of the  filename.  If  the
              directory  name, dirname, is also specified then it is prepended
              to each file name in the <listfile>.

       -h, -help
              Show help and usage for this command.

       -help-list
              Show help and usage for this command without  grouping  the  op‐
              tions into categories.

       -l <x> Searches  for  the library libx.a in the library search path. If
              the string <x> ends with ‘.o’, then the library ‘x’ is  searched
              for  without  prepending ‘lib’ or appending ‘.a’. If the library
              is found, it is added to the list of input files. Otherwise,  an
              error is raised.

       -L <dir>
              Adds <dir> to the list of directories in which to search for li‐
              braries. The directories are searched in the order in which they
              are  specified  with  -L and before the default search path. The
              default search path  includes  directories  /lib,  /usr/lib  and
              /usr/local/lib.

       -no_warning_for_no_symbols
              Do not warn about files that have no symbols.

       -o <filename>
              Specify the output file name. Must be specified exactly once.

       -static
              Produces a static library from the input files.

       -U     Use actual timestamps and UIDs/GIDs.

       -V     Display  the  version  of this program and perform any operation
              specified.

       -version
              Display the version of this program and exit immediately.

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-libtool-darwin exits with a non-zero exit code if there is an  er‐
       ror.  Otherwise, it exits with code 0.
