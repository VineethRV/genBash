NAME
       bcp - extract subsets of Boost

SYNOPSIS
       bcp --list [options] module-list
       bcp [options] module-list output-path
       bcp --report [options] module-list html-file
       bcp --help

DESCRIPTION
       Copies  all  the files, including dependencies, found in module-list to
       output-path. output-path must be an existing path.

       With --list, prints the list of all the files in module-list, including
       dependencies.

       With --report, writes the HTML report to html-file.

       With --help, prints a quick usage reminder.

       It  is  useful  for  Boost authors who want to distribute their library
       separately from Boost and for Boost users who want to distribute a sub‐
       set of Boost with their application.

   module-list
       When  the  --scan  option is not used, a list of Boost files or library
       names to copy. It can be:

              -  The  name  of  a  tool:  for  example   "build"   will   find
              "tools/build".

              - The name of a library: for example "regex".

              -  The  title  of  a  header: for example "scoped_ptr" will find
              "boost/scoped_ptr.hpp".

              - The name of a header: for example "scoped_ptr.hpp"  will  find
              "boost/scoped_ptr.hpp".

              - The name of a file: for example "boost/regex.hpp".

       When the --scan option is used, a list of (probably non-boost) files to
       scan for Boost dependencies, the files  in  the  module  list  are  not
       therefore copied/listed.

   File dependencies
       C++  source  files  are scanned for #includes, all #includes present in
       the Boost source tree will then be scanned for their  dependencies  and
       so on.

       C++ source files are associated with the name of a library, if that li‐
       brary has source code (and possibly  build  data),  then  include  that
       source in the dependencies.

       C++  source files are checked for dependencies on Boost.Test (for exam‐
       ple to see if they use cpp_main as an entry point).

       HTML files are scanned for immediate  dependencies  (images  and  style
       sheets, but not links).

   HTML report contains:
       -  all  the  licenses in effect, plus the files using each license, and
       the copyright holders using each license

       - any files with no recognizable license (please report  these  to  the
       Boost mailing lists)

       - any files with no recognizable copyright holders (please report these
       to the Boost mailing lists)

       - all the copyright holders and the files on which they hold copyright

       - file dependency information - indicates the reason for the  inclusion
       of any particular file in the dependencies found

OPTIONS
       --boost=path
              sets the location of the Boost tree to path

       --scan treat the module list as a list of (possibly non-boost) files to
              scan for Boost dependencies

       --cvs  only copy files under CVS version control

       --unix-lines
              make sure that all copied files use Unix style line endings

EXAMPLES
       bcp scoped_ptr /foo
              Copies boost/scoped_ptr.hpp and dependencies to /foo.

       bcp boost/regex.hpp /foo
              Copies boost/regex.hpp and all dependencies including the  regex
              source   code   (in   libs/regex/src)   and   build   files  (in
              libs/regex/build) to /foo.  Does not copy the  regex  documenta‐
              tion, test or example code.

       bcp regex /foo
              Copies the full regex lib (in libs/regex) including dependencies
              (such as the Boost.Test source required by the regex  test  pro‐
              grams) to /foo.

       bcp regex config build /foo
              Copies  the  full  regex lib (in libs/regex) plus the config lib
              (libs/config) and the build system (tools/build) to /foo includ‐
              ing all the dependencies.

       bcp --scan --boost=/boost foo.cpp bar.cpp boost
              Scans the [non-boost] files foo.cpp and bar.cpp for Boost depen‐
              dencies and  copies  those  dependencies  to  the  sub-directory
              boost.

       bcp --report regex.hpp boost-regex-report.html
              Creates  a  HTML  report  called boost-regex-report.html for the
              Boost module regex.hpp.
