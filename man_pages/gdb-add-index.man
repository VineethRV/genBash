GDB-ADD-INDEX(1)             GNU Development Tools            GDB-ADD-INDEX(1)

NAME
       gdb-add-index - Add index files to speed up GDB

SYNOPSIS
       gdb-add-index filename

DESCRIPTION
       When GDB finds a symbol file, it scans the symbols in the file in order
       to construct an internal symbol table.  This lets most GDB operations
       work quickly--at the cost of a delay early on.  For large programs,
       this delay can be quite lengthy, so GDB provides a way to build an
       index, which speeds up startup.

       To determine whether a file contains such an index, use the command
       "readelf -S filename": the index is stored in a section named
       ".gdb_index".  The index file can only be produced on systems which use
       ELF binaries and DWARF debug information (i.e., sections named
       ".debug_*").

       gdb-add-index uses GDB and objdump found in the PATH environment
       variable.  If you want to use different versions of these programs, you
       can specify them through the GDB and OBJDUMP environment variables.

       See more in the GDB manual in node "Index Files" -- shell command "info
       -f gdb -n "Index Files"".

OPTIONS
SEE ALSO
       The full documentation for GDB is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If
       the "info" and "gdb" programs and GDB's Texinfo documentation are
       properly installed at your site, the command

               info gdb

       should give you access to the complete manual.
