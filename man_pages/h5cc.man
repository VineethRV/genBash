h5cc(1)                     General Commands Manual                    h5cc(1)

NAME
       h5cc - Helper script to compile HDF5 applications.

SYNOPSIS
       h5cc [OPTIONS] <compile line>

DESCRIPTION
       h5cc  can be used in much the same way MPIch is used to compile an HDF5
       program. It takes care of specifying where the HDF5  header  files  and
       libraries are on the command line.

       h5cc  supercedes all other compiler scripts in that if you've used them
       to compile the HDF5 library, then h5cc also uses those scripts. For ex‐
       ample,  when  compiling  an MPIch program, you use the mpicc script. If
       you've built HDF5 using MPIch, then h5cc uses  the  MPIch  program  for
       compilation.

       Some programs use HDF5 in only a few modules. It isn't necessary to use
       h5cc to compile those modules which don't use HDF5. In fact, since h5cc
       is  only  a convenience script, you are still able to compile HDF5 mod‐
       ules in the normal way. In that case, you will have to specify the HDF5
       libraries and include paths yourself.

       An  example  of  how to use h5cc to compile the program hdf_prog, which
       consists of modules prog1.c and prog2.c and uses the  HDF5  shared  li‐
       brary, would be as follows:
              #  h5cc  -c  prog1.c # h5cc -c prog2.c # h5cc -shlib -o hdf_prog
              prog1.o prog2.o

OPTIONS
       -help  Prints a help message.

       -echo  Show all the shell commands executed.

       -prefix=DIR
              Use the directory DIR to find the HDF5 lib/ and include/  subdi‐
              rectories.  Default: prefix specified when configuring HDF5.

       -show  Show the commands without executing them.

       -shlib Compile using shared HDF5 libraries.

       -noshlib
              Compile using static HDF5 libraries [default].

       <compile line>
              The normal compile line options for your compiler. h5cc uses the
              same compiler you used to compile HDF5.  Check  your  compiler's
              manual for more information on which options are needed.

ENVIRONMENT
       HDF5_CC
              Use a different C compiler.

       HDF5_CLINKER
              Use a different linker.

       HDF5_USE_SHLIB=[yes|no]
              Use shared version of the HDF5 library [default: no].
