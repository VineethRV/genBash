NAME
       cct - Coordinate Conversion and Transformation

SYNOPSIS
          cct [-cIostvz [args]] +opt[=arg] ... file ...

       or
          cct [-cIostvz [args]] {object_definition} file ...

       Where  {object_definition} is  one  of  the  possibilities  accepted by
       proj_create(), provided it expresses a coordinate operation

          • a proj-string,

          • a WKT string,

          • an object  code  (like  "EPSG:1671"  "urn:ogc:def:coordinateOpera‐
            tion:EPSG::1671"),

          • an  object  name. e.g. "ITRF2014 to ETRF2014 (1)". In that case as
            uniqueness is not guaranteed, heuristics are applied to  determine
            the appropriate best match.

          • a  OGC  URN combining references for concatenated operations (e.g.
            "‐
            urn:ogc:def:coordinateOperation,coordinateOperation:EPSG::3895,co‐
            ordinateOperation:EPSG::1618")

          • a     PROJJSON     string.     The      jsonschema      is      at
            https://proj.org/schemas/v0.4/projjson.schema.json

          New in version 8.0.0.

          NOTE:
              Before  version 8.0.0 only proj-strings could be used to instan‐
              tiate operations in cct.

       or
          cct [-cIostvz [args]] {object_reference} file ...

       where {object_reference} is a filename preceded by the  '@'  character.
       The file referenced by the {object_reference} must contain a valid {ob‐
       ject_definition}.
          New in version 8.0.0.

DESCRIPTION
       cct is a 4D equivalent to the proj projection program, performs  trans‐
       formation  coordinate  systems on a set of input points. The coordinate
       system transformation can include translation between projected and ge‐
       ographic coordinates as well as the application of datum shifts.

       The following control parameters can appear in any order:

       -c <x,y,z,t>
              Specify  input  columns for (up to) 4 input parameters. Defaults
              to 1,2,3,4.

       -d <n> New in version 5.2.0.

              Specify the number of decimals in the output.

       -I     Do the inverse transformation.

       -o <output file name>, --output=<output file name>
              Specify the name of the output file.

       -t <time>, --time=<time>
              Specify a fixed observation time to be used for all input data.

       -z <height>, --height=<height>
              Specify a fixed observation height to  be  used  for  all  input
              data.

       -s <n>, --skip-lines=<n>
              New in version 5.1.0.

              Skip the first n lines of input. This applies to any kind of in‐
              put, whether it comes from STDIN, a file or interactive user in‐
              put.

       -v, --verbose
              Write  non-essential,  but  potentially  useful,  information to
              stderr.  Repeat for additional information (-vv, -vvv, etc.)

       --version
              Print version number.

       The +opt arguments are associated with coordinate operation parameters.
       Usage varies with operation.

       cct is an acronym meaning Coordinate Conversion and Transformation.

       The  acronym  refers to definitions given in the OGC 08-015r2/ISO-19111
       standard "Geographical Information -- Spatial  Referencing  by  Coordi‐
       nates", which defines two different classes of coordinate operations:

       Coordinate Conversions, which are coordinate operations where input and
       output datum are identical (e.g. conversion from geographical to carte‐
       sian coordinates) and

       Coordinate Transformations, which are coordinate operations where input
       and output datums differ (e.g. change of reference frame).

USE OF REMOTE GRIDS
       New in version 7.0.0.

       If the PROJ_NETWORK environment variable is set to ON, cct will attempt
       to  use  remote grids stored on CDN (Content Delivery Network) storage,
       when they are not available locally.

       More details are available in the network section.

EXAMPLES
       1. The operator specs describe the action to be performed  by  cct.  So
          the following script

          echo 12 55 0 0 | cct +proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=GRS80

       will  transform the input geographic coordinates into UTM zone 32 coor‐
       dinates.  Hence, the command

          echo 12 55 | cct -z0 -t0 +proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=GRS80

       Should give results comparable to the classic proj command

          echo 12 55 | proj +proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=GRS80

       2. Convert geographical input to UTM zone 32 on the GRS80 ellipsoid:

          cct +proj=utm +ellps=GRS80 +zone=32

       3. Roundtrip accuracy check for the case above:

          cct +proj=pipeline +proj=utm +ellps=GRS80 +zone=32 +step +step +inv

       4. As (2) but specify input columns for longitude, latitude, height and
          time:

          cct -c 5,2,1,4 +proj=utm +ellps=GRS80 +zone=32

       5. As  (2) but specify fixed height and time, hence needing only 2 cols
          in input:

          cct -t 0 -z 0 +proj=utm +ellps=GRS80 +zone=32

       6. Auxiliary data following the coordinate input is forward to the out‐
          put stream:

          $ echo 12 56 100 2018.0 auxiliary data | cct +proj=merc
          1335833.8895   7522963.2411      100.0000     2018.0000 auxiliary data

       7. Coordinate operation referenced through its code

          $ echo 3541657.3778 948984.2343 5201383.5231 2020.5 | cct EPSG:8366
          3541657.9112    948983.7503  5201383.2482     2020.5000

       8. Coordinate operation referenced through its name

          $ echo 3541657.3778 948984.2343 5201383.5231 2020.5 | cct "ITRF2014 to ETRF2014 (1)"
          3541657.9112    948983.7503  5201383.2482     2020.5000

BACKGROUND
       cct also refers to Carl Christian Tscherning (1942--2014), professor of
       Geodesy at the University of Copenhagen, mentor and advisor for a  gen‐
       eration of Danish geodesists, colleague and collaborator for two gener‐
       ations of global geodesists, Secretary General  for  the  International
       Association  of  Geodesy, IAG (1995--2007), fellow of the American Geo‐
       physical Union (1991), recipient of the IAG Levallois Medal (2007), the
       European Geosciences Union Vening Meinesz Medal (2008), and of numerous
       other honours.

       cct, or Christian, as he was known to most of us,  was  recognized  for
       his  good mood, his sharp wit, his tireless work, and his great commit‐
       ment to the development of geodesy -- both through his scientific  con‐
       tributions, comprising more than 250 publications, and by his mentoring
       and teaching of the next generations of geodesists.

       As Christian was an avid Fortran programmer, and a keen  Unix  connois‐
       seur,  he would have enjoyed to know that his initials would be used to
       name a modest Unix style transformation filter, hinting at the tireless
       aspect  of  his  personality, which was certainly one of the reasons he
       accomplished so much, and meant so much to so many people.

       Hence, in honour of cct (the geodesist) this is cct (the program).
