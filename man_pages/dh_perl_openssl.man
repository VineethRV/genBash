NAME
       dh_perl_openssl - add dependencies required for OpenSSL modules

SYNOPSIS
       dh_perl_openssl [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_perl_openssl is a debhelper program that is responsible for adding a
       dependency on perl-openssl-abi-* to the ${perl:Depends} substitution
       variable.  Such a dependency is needed for packages that expose the
       OpenSSL binary interface to Perl code, such as pointers to "SSL_CTX"
       structs.

       A debhelper addon is also provided.  This makes it possible to just use

         #!/usr/bin/make -f
         %:
                 dh $@ --with perl_openssl

       for debian/rules.

       Alternatively, since perl-openssl-defaults/4 you can just build depend
       on dh-sequence-perl-openssl and omit the "--with perl_openssl" part.
