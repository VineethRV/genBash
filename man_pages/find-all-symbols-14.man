NAME
       find-all-symbols - manual page for find-all-symbols 14

DESCRIPTION
       USAGE: find-all-symbols [options] <source0> [... <sourceN>]

       OPTIONS:

       Generic Options:

       --help                       - Display available options (--help-hidden
              for more)

       --help-list                  -  Display  list  of   available   options
              (--help-list-hidden for more)

       --version                   - Display the version of this program

       find_all_symbols options:

       --extra-arg=<string>        - Additional argument to append to the com‐
              piler command line

       --extra-arg-before=<string> - Additional argument  to  prepend  to  the
              compiler command line

       --merge-dir=<string>        -
              The directory for merging symbols.

       --output-dir=<string>       -
              The output directory for saving the results.

       -p=<string>                 - Build path

       -p <build-path> is used to read a compile command database.

              For  example,  it can be a CMake build directory in which a file
              named  compile_commands.json  exists  (use   -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COM‐
              PILE_COMMANDS=ON CMake option to get this output). When no build
              path is specified, a search for  compile_commands.json  will  be
              attempted  through  all  parent  paths of the first input file .
              See:   https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.html
              for an example of setting up Clang Tooling on a source tree.

       <source0> ... specify the paths of source files. These paths are

              looked up in the compile command database. If the path of a file
              is absolute, it needs to point into CMake's source tree. If  the
              path  is  relative, the current working directory needs to be in
              the CMake source tree and the file must be in a subdirectory  of
              the  current  working  directory.  "./" prefixes in the relative
              files will be automatically removed, but the rest of a  relative
              path must be a suffix of a path in the compile command database.
