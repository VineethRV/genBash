DESCRIPTION
       usage: h5pcc [OPTIONS] <compile line>

              OPTIONS:

       -help  This help message.

       -echo  Show all the shell commands executed

       -prefix=DIR
              Prefix directory to find HDF5 lib/ and include/

              subdirectories [default: /usr]

       usage: h5pcc [OPTIONS] <compile line>

              OPTIONS:

       -help  This help message.

       -echo  Show all the shell commands executed

       -prefix=DIR
              Prefix directory to find HDF5 lib/ and include/

              subdirectories [default: /usr]

       -show  Show the commands without executing them

       -showconfig
              Show the HDF5 library configuration summary

       -shlib Compile with shared HDF5 libraries [default for hdf5 built with‚Äê
              out static libraries]

       -noshlib
              Compile with static HDF5 libraries [default for hdf5 built  with
              static libraries]

       <compile line>
              - the normal compile line options for your compiler.

       h5pcc uses the same compiler you used to compile
              HDF5.  Check with your compiler's man pages for more information
              on which options are needed.

              You can override the compiler, linker, and whether or not to use
              static  or  shared  libraries to compile your program by setting
              the following environment variables accordingly:

       HDF5_CC
              -  use a different C compiler

       HDF5_CLINKER
              -  use a different linker

       HDF5_USE_SHLIB=[yes|no]
              -  use shared or static version of the HDF5 library

       [default: no except when built with only
              shared libraries]

              You can also add or change paths and flags to the  compile  line
              using the following environment varibles or by assigning them to
              their counterparts in the 'Things You Can Modify to Override...'
              section of h5pcc

       Variable
              Current value to be replaced

       HDF5_CPPFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_CFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_LDFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_LIBS
              ""

              Note  that  adding  library  paths to HDF5_LDFLAGS where another
              hdf5 version is located may link your program  with  that  other
              hdf5 library version.
