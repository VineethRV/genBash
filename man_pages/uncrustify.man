UNCRUSTIFY(1)                    User Commands                   UNCRUSTIFY(1)

NAME
       uncrustify - C, C++, C#, D, Java and Pawn source code beautifier

SYNOPSIS
       uncrustify [OPTIONS] [FILES]

DESCRIPTION
       If no input files are specified, the input is read from stdin.
       If reading from stdin, you should specify the language using -l.

       If  -F  is  used or files are specified on the command line, the output
       filename is PFX + "/" + filename + SFX.
       Unless, of course, the options --replace or --no-backup are used.

       When reading from stdin or doing a single file via the '-f' option, the
       output is dumped to stdout, unless redirected with -o FILE.

       Errors are always dumped to stderr

OPTIONS
   Basic Options:
       -c CFG Use the config file CFG, or defaults if CFG is set to '-'.
              If  not  specified,  uncrustify  will  use $UNCRUSTIFY_CONFIG or
              $HOME/.uncrustify.cfg.

       -f FILE
              Process the single file FILE, sending output to  stdout  or  the
              file specified with -o.

       -o FILE
              Redirect output to FILE.
              Use  with  -f, --update-config, --update-config-with-doc, --uni‐
              versalindent.

       --check
              Do not output the new text, instead verify that nothing  changes
              when  the  file(s)  are  processed.  The status of every file is
              printed to stderr. The exit code is EXIT_SUCCESS if  there  were
              no changes, EXIT_FAILURE otherwise.

       -F FILE
              Read files to process from FILE, one filename per line.  If FILE
              is ´-´ then read filenames from  standard  input  instead  of  a
              file.
              You  can  create  this  file  using something like ´find . -name
              "*.c" > list.txt´.
              This cannot be combined with -f.

       --prefix PFX
              Prepend PFX to the output filename path.
              This cannot be combined with -f, --replace, or --no-backup.

       --suffix SFX
              Append SFX to the output filename.
              The default is '.uncrustify' if neither SFX or  PFX  are  speci‐
              fied.
              This cannot be combined with -f, --replace, or --no-backup.

       --frag Assume  the input is a code fragment and the first line is prop‐
              erly indented.

       --replace
              Replace source files (creates a backup).
              This cannot be combined with -f, --prefix, or --suffix.

       --no-backup
              Replace files, no backup. Useful if files are under source  con‐
              trol
              This cannot be combined with -f, --prefix, or --suffix.

       --mtime
              Preserve mtime on replaced files.

       -l     Language override: C, CPP, D, CS, JAVA, PAWN, VALA, OC, OC+

       -t     Load a file with types (usually not needed)

       -q     Quiet mode - no output on stderr (-L will override)

   Config/Help Options:
       -h -? --help --usage
              Print this message and exit

       --version
              Print the version and exit

       --count-options
              Print the number of available options and exit

       --show-config
              Print out option documentation and exit

       --update-config
              Output a new config file.

       --update-config-with-doc
              Output a new config file with embedded usage comments.

       --universalindent
              Output a config file for Universal Indent GUI.

       --detect
              Detects  the config from a source file. Use with '-f FILE'.  De‐
              tection is currently fairly limited.

   Debug Options:
       -p FILE
              Dump debug info into FILE, or to stdout if FILE is set to '-'."
              Must be used in combination with '-f FILE'."

       -L SEV Set the log severity (see log_levels.h)

       -s     Show the log severity in the logs

       --decode FLAG
              Print FLAG as text and exit

EXAMPLES
       Read a D file from stdin, output to stdout.
              cat foo.d | uncrustify -q -c my.cfg -l d

       Process a file, output to stdout.
              uncrustify -c my.cfg -d foo.d

       Process a source tree, output to a different tree.
              find src -name "*.[ch]" > files.txt
              uncrustify -c my.cfg -F files.txt --prefix out

       Process a source tree in‐place.
              uncrustify -c my.cfg --no-backup $(find src -name "*.[ch]")

NOTES
       Use comments containing ' *INDENT-OFF*' and ' *INDENT-ON*'  to  disable
       processing of parts of the source file.
