DESCRIPTION
       This utility script (available on Unix systems) can be used  to  deter‐
       mine various information about a GDAL installation. It is normally just

       queried by an end user.

       --prefix
              the top level directory for the GDAL installation.

       --libs The libraries and link directives required to use GDAL.

       --cflags
              The  include  and  macro definition required to compiled modules
              using GDAL.

       --version
              Reports the GDAL version.

       --ogr-enabled
              Reports "yes" or "no" to standard output  depending  on  whether
              OGR is built into GDAL.

       --formats
              Reports which formats are configured into GDAL to stdout.
