REINDEXDB(1)            PostgreSQL 14.13 Documentation            REINDEXDB(1)

NAME
       reindexdb - reindex a PostgreSQL database

SYNOPSIS
       reindexdb [connection-option...] [option...]
                 [ -S | --schema schema ]...  [ -t | --table table ]...
                 [ -i | --index index ]...  [dbname]

       reindexdb [connection-option...] [option...] -a | --all

       reindexdb [connection-option...] [option...] -s | --system  [dbname]

DESCRIPTION
       reindexdb is a utility for rebuilding indexes in a PostgreSQL database.

       reindexdb is a wrapper around the SQL command REINDEX. There is no
       effective difference between reindexing databases via this utility and
       via other methods for accessing the server.

OPTIONS
       reindexdb accepts the following command-line arguments:

       -a
       --all
           Reindex all databases.

       --concurrently
           Use the CONCURRENTLY option. See REINDEX(7), where all the caveats
           of this option are explained in detail.

       [-d] dbname
       [--dbname=]dbname
           Specifies the name of the database to be reindexed, when -a/--all
           is not used. If this is not specified, the database name is read
           from the environment variable PGDATABASE. If that is not set, the
           user name specified for the connection is used. The dbname can be a
           connection string. If so, connection string parameters will
           override any conflicting command line options.

       -e
       --echo
           Echo the commands that reindexdb generates and sends to the server.

       -i index
       --index=index
           Recreate index only. Multiple indexes can be recreated by writing
           multiple -i switches.

       -j njobs
       --jobs=njobs
           Execute the reindex commands in parallel by running njobs commands
           simultaneously. This option may reduce the processing time but it
           also increases the load on the database server.

           reindexdb will open njobs connections to the database, so make sure
           your max_connections setting is high enough to accommodate all
           connections.

           Note that this option is incompatible with the --index and --system
           options.

       -q
       --quiet
           Do not display progress messages.

       -s
       --system
           Reindex database's system catalogs only.

       -S schema
       --schema=schema
           Reindex schema only. Multiple schemas can be reindexed by writing
           multiple -S switches.

       -t table
       --table=table
           Reindex table only. Multiple tables can be reindexed by writing
           multiple -t switches.

       --tablespace=tablespace
           Specifies the tablespace where indexes are rebuilt. (This name is
           processed as a double-quoted identifier.)

       -v
       --verbose
           Print detailed information during processing.

       -V
       --version
           Print the reindexdb version and exit.

       -?
       --help
           Show help about reindexdb command line arguments, and exit.

       reindexdb also accepts the following command-line arguments for
       connection parameters:

       -h host
       --host=host
           Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is
           running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the
           directory for the Unix domain socket.

       -p port
       --port=port
           Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file extension
           on which the server is listening for connections.

       -U username
       --username=username
           User name to connect as.

       -w
       --no-password
           Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password
           authentication and a password is not available by other means such
           as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt will fail. This option
           can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to
           enter a password.

       -W
       --password
           Force reindexdb to prompt for a password before connecting to a
           database.

           This option is never essential, since reindexdb will automatically
           prompt for a password if the server demands password
           authentication. However, reindexdb will waste a connection attempt
           finding out that the server wants a password. In some cases it is
           worth typing -W to avoid the extra connection attempt.

       --maintenance-db=dbname
           Specifies the name of the database to connect to to discover which
           databases should be reindexed, when -a/--all is used. If not
           specified, the postgres database will be used, or if that does not
           exist, template1 will be used. This can be a connection string. If
           so, connection string parameters will override any conflicting
           command line options. Also, connection string parameters other than
           the database name itself will be re-used when connecting to other
           databases.

ENVIRONMENT
       PGDATABASE
       PGHOST
       PGPORT
       PGUSER
           Default connection parameters

       PG_COLOR
           Specifies whether to use color in diagnostic messages. Possible
           values are always, auto and never.

       This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the
       environment variables supported by libpq (see Section 34.15).

DIAGNOSTICS
       In case of difficulty, see REINDEX(7) and psql(1) for discussions of
       potential problems and error messages. The database server must be
       running at the targeted host. Also, any default connection settings and
       environment variables used by the libpq front-end library will apply.

NOTES
       reindexdb might need to connect several times to the PostgreSQL server,
       asking for a password each time. It is convenient to have a ~/.pgpass
       file in such cases. See Section 34.16 for more information.

EXAMPLES
       To reindex the database test:

           $ reindexdb test

       To reindex the table foo and the index bar in a database named abcd:

           $ reindexdb --table=foo --index=bar abcd
