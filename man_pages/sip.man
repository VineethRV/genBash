NAME
       sip - generates C++/Python bindings

SYNOPSIS
       sip [-h] [-V] [-a file] [-b file] [-B tag] [-c dir] [-d file] [-D] [-e]
       [-f] [-g] [-I dir] [-j number] [-k] [-m file] [-n name] [-o]  [-p  mod‐
       ule]  [-P]  [-r]  [-s  suffix]  [-t tag] [-w] [-x feature] [-X id:file]

DESCRIPTION
       sip takes a set of specification files and generates C++ code, documen‐
       tation and build files.

       The format of the needed specification file is similar to a C++ header.
       sip includes run-time support for the generated code.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -V     Display the sip version number.

       -a file

              not be generated.

       -b file
              The  name  of  the  build file. If not indicated, it will not be
              generated.

       -B tag Add tag to the list of timeline backstops (deprecated).

       -c dir The name of the directory where generated source  file  will  be
              put.  If not indicated, no code will be generated.

       -d file
              The  name  of the documentation file (deprecated).  If not indi‐
              cated, no documentation will be generated.

       -I dir Directory where sip can search for included files.

       -j number
              Splits the generated code in number files (1 by  default).  This

       -k     Support keyword arguments in functions and methods.

       -m file

       -z file
