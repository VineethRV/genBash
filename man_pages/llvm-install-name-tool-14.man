NAME
       llvm-install-name-tool  -  LLVM tool for manipulating install-names and
       rpaths

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-install-name-tool [options] input

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-install-name-tool is a tool to manipulate dynamic  shared  library
       install names and rpaths listed in a Mach-O binary.

       For  most  scenarios, it works as a drop-in replacement for Apple’s in‐
       stall_name_tool.

OPTIONS
       At least one of the following options are required,  and  some  options
       can  be combined with other options. Options -add_rpath, -delete_rpath,
       and -rpath can be combined in an invocation only if they do  not  share
       the same <rpath> value.

       -add_rpath <rpath>
              Add an rpath named <rpath> to the specified binary. Can be spec‐
              ified multiple times to add multiple rpaths. Throws an error  if
              <rpath> is already listed in the binary.

       -change <old_install_name> <new_install_name>
              Change  an install name <old_install_name> to <new_install_name>
              in the specified binary. Can  be  specified  multiple  times  to
              change  multiple  dependent shared library install names. Option
              is ignored if <old_install_name> is not listed in the  specified
              binary.

       -delete_rpath <rpath>
              Delete  an rpath named <rpath> from the specified binary. Can be
              specified multiple times to delete multiple  rpaths.  Throws  an
              error if <rpath> is not listed in the binary.

       -delete_all_rpaths
              Deletes all rpaths from the binary.

       --help, -h
              Print a summary of command line options.

       -id <name>
              Change shared library’s identification name under LC_ID_DYLIB to
              <name> in the specified binary.  If  specified  multiple  times,
              only  the  last -id option is selected. Option is ignored if the
              specified Mach-O binary is not a dynamic shared library.

       -rpath <old_rpath> <new_rpath>
              Change an rpath named <old_rpath> to <new_rpath> in  the  speci‐
              fied  binary. Can be specified multiple times to change multiple
              rpaths. Throws an error if <old_rpath> is not listed in the  bi‐
              nary or <new_rpath> is already listed in the binary.

       --version, -V
              Display the version of the llvm-install-name-tool executable.

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-install-name-tool  exits  with a non-zero exit code if there is an
       error.  Otherwise, it exits with code 0.
