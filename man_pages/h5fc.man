FORTRAN(1)                       User Commands                      FORTRAN(1)

NAME
       Fortran  - Reports statistics regarding an HDF5 file and the objects in
       the file.

DESCRIPTION
       usage: h5fc [OPTIONS] <compile line>

              OPTIONS:

       -help  This help message.

       -echo  Show all the shell commands executed

       -prefix=DIR
              Prefix directory to find HDF5 lib/ and include/

              subdirectories [default: /usr]

       -show  Show the commands without executing them

       -showconfig
              Show the HDF5 library configuration summary

       -shlib Compile with shared HDF5 libraries

       -noshlib
              Compile with static HDF5 libraries [default]

       <compile line>
              - the normal compile line options for your compiler.

              h5fc uses the same compiler you used to compile HDF5. Check with
              your  compiler's man pages for more information on which options
              are needed.

              You can override the compiler and linker to compile your program
              by setting the following environment variables accordingly:

       HDF5_FC
              -  use a different Fortran 90 or 95 compiler

       HDF5_FLINKER
              -  use a different linker

       HDF5_USE_SHLIB=[yes|no]
              -  use shared or static version of the HDF5 library

              [default: no]

              You  can  also add or change paths and flags to the compile line
              using the following environment varibles or by assigning them to
              their counterparts in the 'Things You Can Modify to Override...'
              section of h5fc

       Variable
              Current value to be replaced

       HDF5_FFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_LDFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_LIBS
              ""

              Note that adding library paths  to  HDF5_LDFLAGS  where  another
              hdf5  version  is  located may link your program with that other
              hdf5 library version.
