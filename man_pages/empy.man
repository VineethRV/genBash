EMPY(1)                     General Commands Manual                    EMPY(1)

NAME
       empy -  A powerful and robust templating system for Python

SYNOPSIS
       empy [options] [<filename, or  '-' for stdin>  [<argument>]]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the empy command.

       EmPy  is  a  system  for embedding Python expressions and statements in
       template text; it takes an EmPy source file, processes it, and produces
       output.  This is accomplished via expansions, which are special signals
       to the EmPy system and are set off by a special prefix (by default  the
       at sign, @).

       EmPy  can  expand  arbitrary  Python expressions and statements in this
       way, as well as a variety of special forms. Textual data not explicitly
       delimited in this way is sent unaffected to the output, allowing Python
       to be used in effect as a markup language. Also supported are callbacks
       via  hooks,  recording and playback via diversions, and dynamic, chain‐
       able filters. The system is highly configurable via  command  line  op‐
       tions and embedded commands.

OPTIONS
       These  programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long op‐
       tions starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included
       below.  For a complete description, see the Info files.
