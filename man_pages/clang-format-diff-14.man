NAME
       clang-format-diff.py - manual page for clang-format-diff.py 14

DESCRIPTION
       usage: clang-format-diff.py [-h] [-i] [-p NUM] [-regex PATTERN]

       [-iregex PATTERN] [-sort-includes] [-v]
              [-style STYLE] [-fallback-style FALLBACK_STYLE] [-binary BINARY]

       This  script  reads  input  from  a  unified diff and reformats all the
       changed lines. This is useful to reformat all the lines  touched  by  a
       specific patch.  Example usage for git/svn users:

              git  diff -U0 --no-color --relative HEAD^ | clang-format-diff.py
              -p1 -i svn diff --diff-cmd=diff -x-U0 | clang-format-diff.py -i

       It should be noted that the filename contained in the diff is used  un‐
       modified  to  determine  the  source file to update. Users calling this
       script directly should be careful to ensure that the path in  the  diff
       is correct relative to the current working directory.

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -i     apply edits to files instead of displaying a diff

       -p NUM strip the smallest prefix containing P slashes

       -regex PATTERN
              custom pattern selecting file paths to reformat (case sensitive,
              overrides -iregex)

       -iregex PATTERN
              custom pattern selecting file paths to reformat  (case  insensi‐
              tive, overridden by -regex)

       -sort-includes
              let clang-format sort include blocks

       -v, --verbose
              be more verbose, ineffective without -i

       -style STYLE
              formatting  style  to apply (LLVM, GNU, Google, Chromium, Micro‐
              soft, Mozilla, WebKit)

       -fallback-style FALLBACK_STYLE
              The name of the predefined  style  used  as  afallback  in  case
              clang-format  is  invoked  with-style=file, but can not find the
              .clang-formatfile to use.

       -binary BINARY
              location of binary to use for clang-format
