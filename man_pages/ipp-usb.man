NAME
       ipp-usb - Daemon for IPP over USB printer support

DESCRIPTION
       ipp-usb  daemon  enables  driver-less printing and scanning on USB-only
       AirPrint-compatible printers and MFPs.

       It works by connecting to the device by USB using  IPP-over-USB  proto‐
       col,  and  exposing  the device to the network, including DNS-SD (Zero‐
       Conf) advertising.

       IPP printing, eSCL scanning and web console are fully supported.

SYNOPSIS
   Usage:
       ipp-usb mode [options]

   Modes are:
       standalone
              run forever, automatically  discover  IPP-over-USB  devices  and
              serve them all

       udev   like  standalone, but exit when last IPP-over-USB device is dis‐
              connected

       debug  logs duplicated on console, -bg option is ignored

       check  check configuration and exit

   Options are
       -bg    run in background (ignored in debug mode)

CONFIGURATION
       ipp-usb  searched  for  its  configuration  file  in  two  places:   1.
       /etc/ipp-usb/ipp-usb.conf  2.  ipp-usb.conf in the directory where exe‐
       cutable file is located

       Configuration file syntax is very similar to .INI files syntax. It con‐
       sist  of named sections, and each section contains a set of named vari‐
       ables. Comments are started from # or ; characters and continues  until
       end of line:

           # This is a comment
           [section 1]
           variable 1 = value 1  ; and another comment
           variable 2 = value 2

   Network parameters
       Network parameters are all in the [network] section:

           [network]
             # TCP ports for HTTP will be automatically allocated in the following range
             http-min-port = 60000
             http-max-port = 65535

             # Enable or disable DNS-SD advertisement
             dns-sd = enable      # enable | disable

             # Network interface to use. Set to `all` if you want to expose you
             # printer to the local network. This way you can share your printer
             # with other computers in the network, as well as with iOS and Android
             # devices.
             interface = loopback # all | loopback

             # Enable or disable IPv6
             ipv6 = enable        # enable | disable

   Logging configuration
       Logging parameters are all in the [logging] section:

           [logging]
             # device-log  - what logs are generated per device
             # main-log    - what common logs are generated
             # console-log - what of generated logs goes to console
             #
             # parameter contains a comma-separated list of
             # the following keywords:
             #   error     - error messages
             #   info      - informative messages
             #   debug     - debug messages
             #   trace-ipp, trace-escl, trace-http - very detailed per-protocol traces
             #   all       - all logs
             #   trace-all - alias to all
             #
             # Note, trace-* implies debug, debug implies info, info implies error
             device-log    = all
             main-log      = debug
             console-log   = debug

             # Log rotation parameters:
             #   log-file-size    - max log file before rotation. Use suffix M
             #                      for megabytes or K for kilobytes
             #   log-backup-files - how many backup files to preserve during rotation
             #
             max-file-size    = 256K
             max-backup-files = 5

             # Enable or disable ANSI colors on console
             console-color = enable # enable | disable

   Quirks
       Some  devices,  due  to  their firmware bugs, require special handling,
       called  device-specific  quirks.  ipp-usb   loads   quirks   from   the
       /usr/share/ipp-usb/quirks/*.conf      files      and      from      the
       /etc/ipp-usb/quirks/*.conf files. The /etc/ipp-usb/quirks directory  is
       for  system  quirks  overrides  or  admin  changes.  These  files  have
       .INI-file syntax with the content that looks like this:

           [HP LaserJet MFP M28-M31]
             http-connection = keep-alive

           [HP OfficeJet Pro 8730]
             http-connection = close

           [HP Inc. HP Laser MFP 135a]
             blacklist = true

           # Default configuration
           [*]
             http-connection = ""

       For each discovered device, its model name is matched against  sections
       of  the  quirks  files.  The section name contains an exact model name,
       which contains iManufacturer+iProduct entries  from  lsusb  -v  command
       output,  or it may contain glob-style wildcards: * that matches any se‐
       quence of characters and ? , that  matches  any  single  character.  To
       match one of these characters (* and ?) literally, use backslash as es‐
       cape.

       All matching sections from all quirks files are taken in consideration,
       and applied in priority order. Priority is computed using the following
       algorithm:

       ○   When matching model name against section name, amount of  non-wild‐
           card matched characters is counted, and the longer match wins

       ○   Otherwise, section loaded first wins. Files are loaded in alphabet‐
           ical order, sections read sequentially

       If some parameter exist in multiple sections, used its value  from  the
       most priority section

       The following parameters are defined:

       blacklist = true | false
              If true, the matching device is ignored by the ipp-usb

       http-XXX = YYY
              Set  XXX header of the HTTP requests forwarded to device to YYY.
              If YYY is empty string, XXX header is removed

       usb-max-interfaces = N
              Don't use more that N USB interfaces, even if more is available

       In case of you found out about your device needs a quirk to work  prop‐
       erly  or  it  does  not  work with ipp-usb at all, although it provides
       IPP-over-USB    interface,    please    report     the     isues     at
       https://github.com/OpenPrinting/ipp-usb. The possible quirk for the de‐
       vice can be added to the project itself and fix the situation  for  all
       device's owners.

FILES
       ○   /etc/ipp-usb/ipp-usb.conf: the daemon configuration file

       ○   /var/log/ipp-usb/main.log: the main log file

       ○   /var/log/ipp-usb/<DEVICE>.log: per-device log files

       ○   /var/ipp-usb/dev/<DEVICE>.state:  device  state  (HTTP port alloca‐
           tion, DNS-SD name)

       ○   /var/ipp-usb/lock/ipp-usb.lock: lock file, that  helps  to  prevent
           multiple copies of daemon to run simultaneously

       ○   /usr/share/ipp-usb/quirks/*.conf:   device-specific   quirks   (see
           above)
