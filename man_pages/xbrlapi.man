NAME
       xbrlapi - X11 BrlAPI helper for Linux/Unix

SYNOPSIS
       xbrlapi [option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       xbrlapi  connects to a BrlAPI server in order to provide it with the ID
       of the X11 window which currently  has  focus.   It  also  simulates  X
       keysyms from braille key presses (else brltty would simulate them using
       a qwerty keyboard). By default, it puts itself in the  background,  un‐
       less option -n is given.

OPTIONS
       Options are processed sequentially from left to right.  If an option is
       specified more than once, or in case of a conflict, the rightmost spec‐
       ification takes precedence.

       The following options are supported:

       -b [host][:port] (--brlapi=)
              The BrlAPI server to connect to.

       -a string (--auth=)
              The BrlAPI authorization/authentication string.

       -d display (--display=)
              The  X  display to connect to.  If not specified, the content of
              the DISPLAY environment variable is used.

       -n (--no-daemon)
              Keep xbrlapi in the foreground.

       -q (--quiet)
              Do not write any text to the braille device.

       -h (--help)
              Print a command line usage summary and then exit.

       -H (--full-help)
              Print a thorough command line usage summary and then exit.
