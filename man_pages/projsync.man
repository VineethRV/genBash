DESCRIPTION
       projsync is a program that downloads remote resource files into a local
       directory. This is an alternative to downloading a proj-data-X.Y.Z  ar‐
       chive file, or using the on-demand networking capabilities of PROJ.

       The following control parameters can appear in any order:

       --endpoint URL
              Defines  the URL where to download the master files.geojson file
              and then the resource  files.  Defaults  to  the  value  set  in
              proj-ini

       --local-geojson-file FILENAME
              Defines  the  filename  for the master GeoJSON files that refer‐
              ences resources.  Defaults to ${endpoint}/files.geojson

       --user-writable-directory
              Specifies that resource files must be  downloaded  in  the  user
              writable directory. This is the default.

       --system-directory
              Specifies  that  resource  files must be downloaded in the ${in‐
              stallation_prefix}/share/proj directory. The user launching pro‐
              jsync should make sure it has writing rights in that directory.

       --target-dir DIRNAME
              Directory into which resource files must be downloaded.

       --bbox west_long,south_lat,east_long,north_lat
              Specify  an  area of interest to restrict the resources to down‐
              load.  The area of interest is specified as a bounding box  with
              geographic  coordinates,  expressed  in degrees in a unspecified
              geographic CRS.   west_long  and  east_long  should  be  in  the
              [-180,180]  range,  and south_lat and north_lat in the [-90,90].
              west_long is generally lower than east_long, except in the  case
              where the area of interest crosses the antimeridian.

       --spatial-test contains|intersects
              Specify how the extent of the resource files are compared to the
              area of use specified explicitly with --bbox.  By  default,  any
              resource  files  whose  extent intersects the value specified by
              --bbox will be selected.  If using the contains  strategy,  only
              resource  files whose extent is contained in the value specified
              by --bbox will be selected.

       --source-id ID
              Restrict  resource  files  to  be  downloaded  to  those   whose
              source_id  property  contains  the  ID value. Specifying ? as ID
              will list all possible values.

       --area-of-use NAME
              Restrict  resource  files  to  be  downloaded  to  those   whose
              area_of_use  property  contains  the NAME value. Specifying ? as
              NAME will list all possible values.

       --file NAME
              Restrict resource files to be downloaded  to  those  whose  name
              property contains the NAME value. Specifying ? as NAME will list
              all possible values.

       --all  Ask to download all files.

       --exclude-world-coverage
              Exclude files which have world coverage.

       -q / --quiet
              Quiet mode

       --verbose
              New in version 8.1.

              Verbose mode (more than default)

       --dry-run
              Simulate the behavior of the tool without  downloading  resource
              files.

       --list-files
              List file names, with the source_id and area_of_use properties.

       --no-version-filtering
              New in version 8.1.

              By default, projsync only downloads files that are compatible of
              the PROJ_DATA.VERSION metadata of proj.db, taking  into  account
              the  version_added  and version_removed properties of entries in
              files.geojson.  When specifying this switch,  all  files  refer‐
              enced  in  files.geojson  will be candidate (combined with other
              filters).

       At least one of  --list-files,   --file,   --source-id,  --area-of-use,
       --bbox or  --all must be specified.

       Options  --file,   --source-id,  --area-of-use  and --bbox are combined
       with a AND logic.

EXAMPLES
       1. Download all resource files

          projsync --all

       2. Download resource files covering specified point and attributing  to
          an agency

          projsync --source-id fr_ign --bbox 2,49,2,49
