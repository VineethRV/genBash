NAME
       llvm-tblgen - Target Description to C++ Code for LLVM

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-tblgen [options] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-tblgen  is  a  program that translates compiler-related target de‚Äê
       scription (.td) files into C++ code  and  other  output  formats.  Most
       users  of  LLVM  will not need to use this program. It is used only for
       writing parts of the compiler.

       Please see tblgen - Description to C++ Code for a  description  of  the
       filename  argument  and  options,  including  the options common to all
       *-tblgen programs.
