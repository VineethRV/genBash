NAME
       fprintd - Fingerprint management daemon, and test applications

SYNOPSIS
       fprintd-enroll [-f finger] [usename]

       fprintd-list username [usernames...]

       fprintd-verify [-f finger] [usename]

       fprintd-delete username [usernames...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the fprintd command-line utilities.

       The fprintd daemon is accessed through D-Bus by those command-line
       utilities.

ARGUMENTS
       username
               The username for the user for which you want to query or modify
               the fingerprint database.

               Not that fprintd-list and fprintd-delete require at least one
               username to be passed, and support multiple usernames.

               fprintd-enroll and fprintd-verify will use the current username
               if none are passed on the command-line.

       -f finger
               For fprintd-enroll, the finger to enroll. Possible values are:

               left-thumb, left-index-finger, left-middle-finger, left-ring-
               finger, left-little-finger, right-thumb, right-index-finger,
               right-middle-finger, right-ring-finger, right-little-finger.

               The default is automatic, selecting the first available finger
               for swipe devices, or all the enrolled fingers, for press
               devices.

TEST APPLICATIONS
   fprintd-enroll
               Will enroll the user's right index finger into the database.

   fprintd-list
               Will list the user's enrolled fingerprints.

   fprintd-verify
               Will verify the user's fingerprints against the database.

   fprintd-delete
               Will delete the user's right index finger into the database.
