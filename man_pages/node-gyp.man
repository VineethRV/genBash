NAME
       node-gyp -- native addon build tool for node

SYNOPSIS
       node-gyp <command> [args]

DESCRIPTION
       node-gyp is a cross-platform command-line tool for compiling native ad‐
       don modules for Node.js, taking away the pain of dealing with the vari‐
       ous  differences  in  build  platforms.   It  is the replacement to the
       node-waf program, which is removed since node 0.8. Native addons  still
       using  a  wscript file should definitely add a binding.gyp file to sup‐
       port the latest versions of node.

       Multiple target versions of node are supported (from node  0.6  to  the
       next  released version), regardless of what version of node is actually
       installed on your system; node-gyp downloads the necessary  development
       files for the target version.

COMMANDS
       •   build Invokes make/msbuild.exe and builds the native addon

       •   clean Removes any the build dir if it exists

       •   configure Generates project build files for the current platform

       •   rebuild Runs clean, configure and build all in a row

       •   install  <version>  Installs  node development header files for the
           given version

       •   list Lists the currently installed node development file versions

       •   remove <version> Removes the node development header files for  the
           given version
