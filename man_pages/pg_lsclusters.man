       pg_lsclusters - show information about all PostgreSQL clusters

SYNOPSIS
       pg_lsclusters [options] [version [cluster]]

DESCRIPTION
       This command list the status and some configuration details of all
       clusters.  If a version and optionally a cluster name are given, only
       these are shown.

OPTIONS
       -h, --no-header
           Do not print the column header line.

       -j, --json
           Output information in JSON format. Needs JSON.pm installed.
           (Debian package: libjson-perl)

       -s, --start-conf
           Include start.conf information in status column.

       --help
           Print usage help.

NOTES
       The cluster status is shown as online or down. If a recovery.conf file
       is found in the data directory, ,recovery is appended. The latter needs
       read access to the data directory, which only root and the cluster
       owner have.

       The output lines are colored green and red to indicate the cluster
       status visually.
