NAME
       make-ssl-cert - Debconf wrapper for openssl

SYNOPSIS
       make-ssl-cert [OPTION]... template output-certificate
       make-ssl-cert [OPTION]... generate-default-snakeoil

DESCRIPTION
       make-ssl-cert  is  a  simple debconf to openssl wrapper to create self-
       signed   certificates.    It   requires   a   source   template    (Ex:
       /usr/share/ssl-cert/ssleay.cnf)  and  it  will  place the new generated
       certificate in the specified output file.
       Invoked   with   "generate-default-snakeoil",    it    will    generate
       /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem   and   /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-
       snakeoil.key.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options are included below.

       --force-overwrite
              Always create a new certificate, even if the  file  already  ex‐
              ists.   For  backwards compatibility with 1.0.x, this option can
              be given as last argument, too.

       --no-overwrite
              Never overwrite an existing file, even if the old  certificate's
              key length is too small or if it uses an obsoltete signature al‐
              gorithm.

       --expiration-days N
              Make the new certificate expire in N days.  Default is 3650.
