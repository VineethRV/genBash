NAME
       gcore - Generate core files for running processes

SYNOPSIS
       gcore [-a] [-o filename] pid[s]

DESCRIPTION
       gcore  generates  a  core file for the process(es) specified by process
       IDs, pid[s]. By default, each core file is written to core.pid, in  the
       current directory.

       -a     (Linux only) ignore /proc/PID/coredump_filter and also dump mem‐
              ory mappings marked with the 'VM_DONTDUMP' flag. See  info  node
              Core File Generation for longer explanation.

       -o filename
              write  core file to filename if one PID, or filename.pid if mul‐
              tiple PIDs, instead of default core.pid
