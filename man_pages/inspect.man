NAME
       inspect - Boost code inspection tool

SYNOPSIS
       inspect [-cvs] [-text] [-brief] [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       It is not uncommon for various common errors or guideline violations to
       creep into the Boost libraries. The inspect program detects and reports
       several  common  problems. It can be used to scan a proposed Boost sub‐
       mission to identify various failures.

       The program is run in the directory to be scanned for  errors.  Sub-di‐
       rectories are also included in the scan.

       If  the  first  program argument is -cvs, only files and directories in
       the CVS tree of the current directory are scanned. Otherwise all  files
       and sub-directories are included in the scan.

              Options:

       -license

       -copyright

       -crlf

       -link

       -path_name

       -tab

       -ascii

       -minmax

       -unnamed

              The  default is to have all checks on; otherwise options specify
              desired checks.
