NAME
     node — server-side JavaScript runtime

SYNOPSIS
     node [options] [v8-options] [-e string | script.js | -] [--]
          [arguments ...]
     node inspect [-e string | script.js | - | <host>:<port>] ...
     node [--v8-options]

DESCRIPTION
     Node.js is a set of libraries for JavaScript which allows it to be used
     outside of the browser.  It is primarily focused on creating simple,
     easy-to-build network clients and servers.

     Execute node without arguments to start a REPL.

OPTIONS
     -       Alias for stdin, analogous to the use of - in other command-line
             utilities.  The executed script is read from stdin, and remaining
             arguments are passed to the script.

     --      Indicate the end of command-line options.  Pass the rest of the
             arguments to the script.

             If no script filename or eval/print script is supplied prior to
             this, then the next argument will be used as a script filename.

     --abort-on-uncaught-exception
             Aborting instead of exiting causes a core file to be generated
             for analysis.

     --completion-bash
             Print source-able bash completion script for Node.js.

     --conditions string
             Use custom conditional exports conditions string

     --cpu-prof
             Start the V8 CPU profiler on start up, and write the CPU profile
             to disk before exit. If --cpu-prof-dir is not specified, the pro‐
             file will be written to the current working directory with a gen‐
             erated file name.

     --cpu-prof-dir
             The directory where the CPU profiles generated by --cpu-prof will
             be placed.  The default value is controlled by the
             --diagnostic-dir.  command line option.

     --cpu-prof-interval
             The sampling interval in microseconds for the CPU profiles gener‐
             ated by --cpu-prof.  The default is 1000.

     --cpu-prof-name
             File name of the V8 CPU profile generated with --cpu-prof

     --diagnostic-dir
             Set the directory for all diagnostic output files.  Default is
             current working directory.  Set the directory to which all diag‐
             nostic output files will be written to.  Defaults to current
             working directory.  Affects the default output directory of:
             --cpu-prof-dir.  --heap-prof-dir.  --redirect-warnings.

     --disable-proto=mode
             Disable the `Object.prototype.__proto__` property. If mode is
             `delete`, the property will be removed entirely. If mode is
             `throw`, accesses to the property will throw an exception with
             the code `ERR_PROTO_ACCESS`.

     --disallow-code-generation-from-strings
             Make built-in language features like `eval` and `new Function`
             that generate code from strings throw an exception instead. This
             does not affect the Node.js `vm` module.

     --enable-fips
             Enable FIPS-compliant crypto at startup.  Requires Node.js to be
             built with ./configure --openssl-fips.

             plicit' (default) or 'node'

     --experimental-vm-modules
             Enable experimental ES module support in VM module.

     --experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1
             Enable experimental WebAssembly System Interface support.

     --experimental-wasm-modules
             Enable experimental WebAssembly module support.

     --force-context-aware
             Disable loading native addons that are not context-aware.

     --force-fips
             Force FIPS-compliant crypto on startup (Cannot be disabled from
             script code).  Same requirements as --enable-fips.

     --frozen-intrinsics
             Enable experimental frozen intrinsics support.

     --heapsnapshot-signal=signal
             Generate heap snapshot on specified signal.

     --heap-prof
             Start the V8 heap profiler on start up, and write the heap pro‐
             file to disk before exit. If --heap-prof-dir is not specified,
             the profile will be written to the current working directory with
             a generated file name.

     --heap-prof-dir
             The directory where the heap profiles generated by --heap-prof
             will be placed.  The default value is controlled by the
             --diagnostic-dir.  command line option.

     --heap-prof-interval
             The average sampling interval in bytes for the heap profiles gen‐
             erated by --heap-prof.  The default is 512 * 1024.

     --heap-prof-name
             File name of the V8 heap profile generated with --heap-prof

     --http-parser=library
             Chooses an HTTP parser library. Available values are llhttp or
             legacy.

     --http-server-default-timeout=milliseconds
             Overrides the default value for server socket timeout.

     --icu-data-dir=file
             Specify ICU data load path.  Overrides NODE_ICU_DATA.

     --input-type=type
             Set the module resolution type for input via --eval, --print or
             STDIN.

     --inspect-brk=[host:]port
             Activate inspector on host:port and break at start of user
             script.

     --inspect-port=[host:]port
             Set the host:port to be used when the inspector is activated.

     --inspect-publish-uid=stderr,http
             Specify how the inspector WebSocket URL is exposed.  Valid values
             are stderr and http.  Default is stderr,http.

     --inspect=[host:]port
             Activate inspector on host:port.  Default is 127.0.0.1:9229.

             V8 Inspector integration allows attaching Chrome DevTools and
             IDEs to Node.js instances for debugging and profiling.  It uses
             the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

     --insecure-http-parser
             Use an insecure HTTP parser that accepts invalid HTTP headers.
             This may allow interoperability with non-conformant HTTP imple‐
             mentations. It may also allow request smuggling and other HTTP
             attacks that rely on invalid headers being accepted. Avoid using
             this option.

     --jitless
             Disable runtime allocation of executable memory. This may be re‐
             quired on some platforms for security reasons. It can also reduce
             attack surface on other platforms, but the performance impact may
             be severe.

             This flag is inherited from V8 and is subject to change upstream.
             It may disappear in a non-semver-major release.

     --max-http-header-size=size
             Specify the maximum size of HTTP headers in bytes. Defaults to
             8KB.

     --napi-modules
             This option is a no-op.  It is kept for compatibility.

     --no-deprecation
             Silence deprecation warnings.

     --no-force-async-hooks-checks
             Disable runtime checks for `async_hooks`.  These will still be
             enabled dynamically when `async_hooks` is enabled.

     --no-warnings
             Silence all process warnings (including deprecations).

     --openssl-config=file
             Load an OpenSSL configuration file on startup.  Among other uses,
             this can be used to enable FIPS-compliant crypto if Node.js is
             built with ./configure --openssl-fips.

     --pending-deprecation
             Emit pending deprecation warnings.

     --policy-integrity=sri
             Instructs Node.js to error prior to running any code if the pol‐
             icy does not have the specified integrity. It expects a Subre‐
             source Integrity string as a parameter.

     --preserve-symlinks
             Instructs the module loader to preserve symbolic links when re‐
             solving and caching modules other than the main module.

     --preserve-symlinks-main
             Instructs the module loader to preserve symbolic links when re‐
             solving and caching the main module.

     --prof  Generate V8 profiler output.

     --prof-process
             Process V8 profiler output generated using the V8 option --prof.

     --redirect-warnings=file
             Write process warnings to the given file instead of printing to
             stderr.

     --report-compact
             Write diagnostic reports in a compact format, single-line JSON.

     --report-dir --report-directory
             Location at which the diagnostic report will be generated.  The
             `file` name may be an absolute path. If it is not, the default
             directory it will be written to is controlled by the
             --diagnostic-dir.  command line option.

     --report-filename
             Name of the file to which the diagnostic report will be written.

     --report-on-fatalerror
             Enables the diagnostic report to be triggered on fatal errors
             (internal errors within the Node.js runtime such as out of mem‐
             ory) that leads to termination of the application. Useful to in‐
             spect various diagnostic data elements such as heap, stack, event
             loop state, resource consumption etc. to reason about the fatal
             error.

     --report-on-signal
             Enables diagnostic report to be generated upon receiving the
             specified (or predefined) signal to the running Node.js process.
             Default signal is SIGUSR2.

     --report-signal
             Sets or resets the signal for diagnostic report generation (not
             supported on Windows). Default signal is SIGUSR2.

     --report-uncaught-exception
             Enables diagnostic report to be generated on un-caught excep‐
             tions. Useful when inspecting JavaScript stack in conjunction
             with native stack and other runtime environment data.

     --throw-deprecation
             Throw errors for deprecations.

     --title=title
             Specify process.title on startup.

     --tls-cipher-list=list
             Specify an alternative default TLS cipher list.  Requires Node.js
             to be built with crypto support. (Default)

     --tls-keylog=file
             Log TLS key material to a file. The key material is in NSS SS‐
             LKEYLOGFILE format and can be used by software (such as Wire‐
             shark) to decrypt the TLS traffic.

     --tls-max-v1.2
             Set default  maxVersion to 'TLSv1.2'. Use to disable support for
             TLSv1.3.

     --tls-max-v1.3
             Set default  maxVersion to 'TLSv1.3'. Use to enable support for
             TLSv1.3.

     --tls-min-v1.0
             Set default minVersion to 'TLSv1'. Use for compatibility with old
             TLS clients or servers.

     --tls-min-v1.1
             Set default minVersion to 'TLSv1.1'. Use for compatibility with
             old TLS clients or servers.

     --tls-min-v1.2
             Set default minVersion to 'TLSv1.2'. This is the default for 12.x
             and later, but the option is supported for compatibility with
             older Node.js versions.

     --tls-min-v1.3
             Set default minVersion to 'TLSv1.3'. Use to disable support for
             TLSv1.2 in favour of TLSv1.3, which is more secure.

     --trace-deprecation
             Print stack traces for deprecations.

     --trace-event-categories categories
             A comma-separated list of categories that should be traced when
             trace event tracing is enabled using --trace-events-enabled.

     --trace-event-file-pattern pattern
             Template string specifying the filepath for the trace event data,
             it supports ${rotation} and ${pid}.

     --trace-events-enabled
             Enable the collection of trace event tracing information.

     --trace-exit
             Prints a stack trace whenever an environment is exited proac‐
             tively, i.e. invoking `process.exit()`.

     --trace-sigint
             Prints a stack trace on SIGINT.

     --trace-sync-io
             Print a stack trace whenever synchronous I/O is detected after
             the first turn of the event loop.

     --trace-tls
             Prints TLS packet trace information to stderr.

     --trace-uncaught
             Print stack traces for uncaught exceptions; usually, the stack
             trace associated with the creation of an Error is printed,
             whereas this makes Node.js also print the stack trace associated
             with throwing the value (which does not need to be an Error in‐
             stance).

             Enabling this option may affect garbage collection behavior nega‐
             tively.

     --trace-warnings
             Print stack traces for process warnings (including deprecations).

     --track-heap-objects
             Track heap object allocations for heap snapshots.

     ---unhandled-rejections=mode
             Define the behavior for unhandled rejections. Can be one of
             `strict` (raise an error), `warn` (enforce warnings) or `none`
             (silence warnings).

     --use-bundled-ca, --use-openssl-ca
             Use bundled Mozilla CA store as supplied by current Node.js ver‐
             sion or use OpenSSL's default CA store.  The default store is se‐
             lectable at build-time.

             The bundled CA store, as supplied by Node.js, is a snapshot of
             Mozilla CA store that is fixed at release time.  It is identical
             on all supported platforms.

             Using OpenSSL store allows for external modifications of the
             store.  For most Linux and BSD distributions, this store is main‐
             tained by the distribution maintainers and system administrators.
             OpenSSL CA store location is dependent on configuration of the
             OpenSSL library but this can be altered at runtime using environ‐
             ment variables.

             See SSL_CERT_DIR and SSL_CERT_FILE.

     --use-largepages=mode
             Re-map the Node.js static code to large memory pages at startup.
             If supported on the target system, this will cause the Node.js
             static code to be moved onto 2 MiB pages instead of 4 KiB pages.

             mode must have one of the following values: `off` (the default
             value, meaning do not map), `on` (map and ignore failure, report‐
             ing it to stderr), or `silent` (map and silently ignore failure).

     --v8-options
             Print V8 command-line options.

     --v8-pool-size=num
             Set V8's thread pool size which will be used to allocate back‐
             ground jobs.  If set to 0 then V8 will choose an appropriate size
             of the thread pool based on the number of online processors.  If
             the value provided is larger than V8's maximum, then the largest
             value will be chosen.

     --zero-fill-buffers
             Automatically zero-fills all newly allocated Buffer and Slow‐
             Buffer instances.

     -c, --check
             Check the script's syntax without executing it.  Exits with an
             error code if script is invalid.

     -e, --eval string
             Evaluate string as JavaScript.

     -h, --help
             Print command-line options.  The output of this option is less
             detailed than this document.

     -i, --interactive
             Open the REPL even if stdin does not appear to be a terminal.

     -p, --print string
             Identical to -e, but prints the result.

     -r, --require module
             Preload the specified module at startup.  Follows `require()`'s
             module resolution rules.  module may be either a path to a file,
             or a Node.js module name.

     -v, --version
             Print node's version.

ENVIRONMENT
     NODE_DEBUG modules...
             Comma-separated list of core modules that should print debug in‐
             formation.

     NODE_DEBUG_NATIVE modules...
             Comma-separated list of C++ core modules that should print debug
             information.

     NODE_DISABLE_COLORS
             When set to 1, colors will not be used in the REPL.

     NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS file
             When set, the well-known “root” CAs (like VeriSign) will be ex‐
             tended with the extra certificates in file.  The file should con‐
             sist of one or more trusted certificates in PEM format.

             If file is missing or misformatted, a message will be emitted
             once using process.emitWarning(), but any errors are otherwise
             ignored.

             This environment variable is ignored when `node` runs as setuid
             root or has Linux file capabilities set.

     NODE_ICU_DATA file
             Data path for ICU (Intl object) data.  Will extend linked-in data
             when compiled with small-icu support.

     NODE_NO_WARNINGS
             When set to 1, process warnings are silenced.

     NODE_OPTIONS options...
             A space-separated list of command-line options, which are inter‐
             preted as if they had been specified on the command-line before
             the actual command (so they can be overridden).  Node.js will
             exit with an error if an option that is not allowed in the envi‐
             ronment is used, such as --print or a script file.

     NODE_PATH directories...
             A colon-separated list of directories prefixed to the module
             search path.

     NODE_PENDING_DEPRECATION
             When set to 1, emit pending deprecation warnings.

     NODE_PRESERVE_SYMLINKS
             When set to 1, the module loader preserves symbolic links when
             resolving and caching modules.

     NODE_REDIRECT_WARNINGS file
             Write process warnings to the given file instead of printing to
             stderr.  Equivalent to passing --redirect-warnings file on com‐
             mand-line.

     NODE_REPL_HISTORY file
             Path to the file used to store persistent REPL history.  The de‐
             fault path is ~/.node_repl_history, which is overridden by this
             variable.  Setting the value to an empty string ("" or " ") will
             disable persistent REPL history.

     NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED
             When set to 0, TLS certificate validation is disabled.

     NODE_V8_COVERAGE dir
             When set, Node.js writes JavaScript code coverage information to
             dir.

     OPENSSL_CONF file
             Load an OpenSSL configuration file on startup.  Among other uses,
             this can be used to enable FIPS-compliant crypto if Node.js is
             built with ./configure --openssl-fips.

             If the --openssl-config command-line option is used, this envi‐
             ronment variable is ignored.

     SSL_CERT_DIR dir
             If --use-openssl-ca is enabled, this overrides and sets OpenSSL's
             directory containing trusted certificates.

     SSL_CERT_FILE file
             If --use-openssl-ca is enabled, this overrides and sets OpenSSL's
             file containing trusted certificates.

     UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE size
             Sets the number of threads used in libuv's threadpool to size.
