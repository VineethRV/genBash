NAME
       pyflakes3 - simple Python 3 source checker

SYNOPSIS
       pyflakes [file-or-directory ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pyflakes3 is a simple program which checks Python source files for
       errors.  It is similar to PyChecker in scope, but differs in that it
       does not execute the modules to check them. This is both safer and
       faster, although it does not perform as many checks. Unlike PyLint,
       Pyflakes checks only for logical errors in programs; it does not
       perform any checks on style.

       All commandline arguments are checked, which have to be either regular
       files or directories. If a directory is given, every .py file within
       will be checked.

       When no commandline arguments are given, data will be read from
       standard input.

OUTPUT
       Found warnings including unused imports, undefined variables and
       unnecessary reimports, are printed on standard output.  Found errors
       including compile or encoding errors, are printed on standard error.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status is 0 when no warnings or errors are found. Otherwise
       the exit status is 1.
