NAME
       dh_python3-ply - generate versioned dependencies on python3-ply

SYNOPSIS
       dh_python3-ply [--dependency-field dependencyfield] [debhelper options]
       file...

DESCRIPTION
       dh_python3-ply is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       generating the python3-ply:Depends substitutions and adding them to
       substvars files.

       The program will look only at Python3 modules that are explicitly
       provided as its arguments, and will use this information to generate a
       strict versioned dependency on python3-ply.

OPTIONS
       --dependency-field dependencyfield
           Use python3-ply:dependencyfield substitution variable instead of
           python3-ply:Depends.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is not a part of debhelper, but it is meant to be used
       together with it.
