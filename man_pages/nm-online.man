NM-ONLINE(1)                General Commands Manual               NM-ONLINE(1)

NAME
       nm-online - ask NetworkManager whether the network is connected

SYNOPSIS
       nm-online [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       nm-online is a utility to find out whether we are online. It is done by
       asking NetworkManager about its status. When run, nm-online waits until
       NetworkManager reports an active connection, or specified timeout
       expires. On exit, the returned status code should be checked (see the
       return codes below).

       This tool is not very useful to call directly. It is however used by
       NetworkManager-wait-online.service with --wait-for-startup argument.
       This is used to delay the service and indirectly network-online.target,
       until networking is up. Don't order your own systemd services after
       NetworkManager-wait-online.service directly. Instead if necessary,
       order your services after network-online.target. Even better is to have
       your services react to network changes dynamically and don't order them
       with respect to network-online.target at all.

       By default, connections have the ipv4.may-fail and ipv6.may-fail
       properties set to yes; this means that NetworkManager waits for one of
       the two address families to complete configuration before considering
       the connection activated. If you need a specific address family
       configured before network-online.target is reached, set the
       corresponding may-fail property to no.

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
           Print help information.

       -q | --quiet
           Don't print anything.

       -s | --wait-for-startup
           Wait for NetworkManager startup to complete, rather than waiting
           for network connectivity specifically. Startup is considered
           complete once NetworkManager has activated (or attempted to
           activate) every auto-activate connection which is available given
           the current network state. This corresponds to the moment when
           NetworkManager logs "startup complete". This mode is generally only
           useful at boot time. After startup has completed, nm-online -s will
           just return immediately, regardless of the current network state.

           There are various ways to affect when startup complete is reached.
           For example, by setting a connection profile to autoconnect, such a
           profile possibly will activate during startup and thus delay
           startup complete being reached. Also, a profile is considered ready
           when it fully reached the logical connected state in
           NetworkManager. That means, properties like ipv4.may-fail and
           ipv6.may-fail affect whether a certain address family is required.
           Also, the connection property connection.wait-device-timeout
           affects whether to wait for the driver to detect a certain device.
           Generally, a failure of NetworkManager-wait-online.service
           indicates a configuration error, where NetworkManager won't be able
           to reach the desired connectivity state during startup. An example
           for that are bridge or bond master profiles, that get autoconnected
           but without activating any slaves. Such master devices hang in
           activating state indefinitely, and cause
           NetworkManager-wait-online.service to fail.

       -t | --timeout seconds
           Time to wait for a connection, in seconds. If the option is not
           provided, the environment variable NM_ONLINE_TIMEOUT is honored.
           The default timeout is 30 seconds.

       -x | --exit
           Exit immediately if NetworkManager is not running or connecting.

EXIT STATUS
       nm-online exits with status 0 if it succeeds, a value greater than 0 is
       returned if an error occurs.

       0
           Success â€“ already online or connection established within given
           timeout.

       1
           Offline or not online within given timeout.

       2
           Unknown or unspecified error.
