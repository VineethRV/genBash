NAME
       pw-profiler - The PipeWire profiler

SYNOPSIS
       pw-profiler [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Start profiling a PipeWire instance.

       If the server has the profiler module loaded, this program will connect
       to it and log the profiler data. Profiler data contains times and dura‐
       tions when processing nodes and devices started and completed.

       When  this  program  is stopped, a set of gnuplot files and a script to
       generate SVG files from the .plot files  is  generated,  along  with  a
       .html file to visualize the profiling results in a browser.

OPTIONS
       -r | --remote=NAME
              The  name the remote instance to monitor. If left unspecified, a
              connection is made to the default PipeWire instance.

       -h | --help
              Show help.

       --version
              Show version information.
