LLVM-AS(1)                           LLVM                           LLVM-AS(1)

NAME
       llvm-as - LLVM assembler

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-as [options] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-as  is the LLVM assembler.  It reads a file containing human-read‐
       able LLVM assembly language, translates it to LLVM bitcode, and  writes
       the result into a file or to standard output.

       If filename is omitted or is -, then llvm-as reads its input from stan‐
       dard input.

       If an output file is not specified with the  -o  option,  then  llvm-as
       sends its output to a file or standard output by following these rules:

       • If the input is standard input, then the output is standard output.

       • If the input is a file that ends with .ll, then the output file is of
         the same name, except that the suffix is changed to .bc.

       • If the input is a file that does not end with the  .ll  suffix,  then
         the  output file has the same name as the input file, except that the
         .bc suffix is appended.

OPTIONS
       -f     Enable binary  output  on  terminals.   Normally,  llvm-as  will
              refuse  to  write  raw  bitcode output if the output stream is a
              terminal. With this option, llvm-as will write raw  bitcode  re‐
              gardless of the output device.

       -help  Print a summary of command line options.

       -o filename
              Specify  the  output  file name.  If filename is -, then llvm-as
              sends its output to standard output.

EXIT STATUS
       If llvm-as succeeds, it will exit with 0.  Otherwise, if an  error  oc‐
       curs, it will exit with a non-zero value.
