NAME
       h5pfc - helper script to compile HDF5 Fortran applications

DESCRIPTION
       usage: h5pfc [OPTIONS] <compile line>

              OPTIONS:

       -help  This help message.

       -echo  Show all the shell commands executed

       -prefix=DIR
              Prefix directory to find HDF5 lib/ and include/

              subdirectories [default: /usr]

       -show  Show the commands without executing them

       -showconfig
              Show the HDF5 library configuration summary

       -shlib Compile with shared HDF5 libraries [default for hdf5 built with‚Äê
              out static libraries]

       -noshlib
              Compile with static HDF5 libraries [default for hdf5 built  with
              static libraries]

       <compile line>
              - the normal compile line options for your compiler.

       h5pfc uses the same compiler you used to compile
              HDF5.  Check with your compiler's man pages for more information
              on which options are needed.

              You can override the compiler and linker to compile your program
              by setting the following environment variables accordingly:

       HDF5_FC
              -  use a different Fortran 90 or 95 compiler

       HDF5_FLINKER
              -  use a different linker

       HDF5_USE_SHLIB=[yes|no]
              -  use shared or static version of the HDF5 library

       [default: no except when built with only
              shared libraries]

              You  can  also add or change paths and flags to the compile line
              using the following environment varibles or by assigning them to
              their counterparts in the 'Things You Can Modify to Override...'
              section of h5pfc

       Variable
              Current value to be replaced

       HDF5_FCFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_LDFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_LIBS
              ""

              Note that adding library paths  to  HDF5_LDFLAGS  where  another
              hdf5  version  is  located may link your program with that other
              hdf5 library version.
