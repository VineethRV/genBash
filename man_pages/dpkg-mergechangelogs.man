NAME
       dpkg-mergechangelogs - 3-way merge of debian/changelog files

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-mergechangelogs [option...] old new-a new-b [out]

DESCRIPTION
       This program will use the 3 provided versions of the Debian changelog
       to generate a merged changelog file. The resulting changelog is stored
       in the file out or output to the standard output if that parameter is
       not given.

       Each entry is identified by its version number and they are assumed to
       be not conflicting, they are simply merged in the right order (by
       decreasing version number). When --merge-prereleases is used, the part
       of the version number after the last tilde is dropped so that
       1.0-1~exp1 and 1.0-1~exp5 are considered to be the same entry. When the
       same version is available in both new-a and new-b, a standard line-
       based 3-way merge is attempted (provided that the module
       Algorithm::Merge is available — it's part of the package libalgorithm-
       merge-perl — otherwise you get a global conflict on the content of the
       entry).

OPTIONS
       --merge-unreleased
           Ignore the version number when the entries are marked as UNRELEASED
           (since dpkg 1.21.0).

           This is useful when you have diverging development for versions
           that have not yet been released. For instance 2.1-1 is released,
           then development happens for the new 2.2-1 and then for 2.3-1,
           where it makes sense to just end with a coalesced entry for 2.3-1
           including all the development done in 2.2-1.

       -m, --merge-prereleases
           Drop the part after the last tilde in the version number when doing
           version comparison to identify if two entries are supposed to be
           the same or not.

           This is useful when you keep using the same changelog entry but you
           increase its version number regularly. For instance, you might have
           2.3-1~exp1, 2.3-1~exp2, ... until the official release 2.3-1 and
           they are all the same changelog entry that has evolved over time.

       --help
           Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
           Show the version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       DPKG_COLORS
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently accepted
           values are: auto (default), always and never.

       DPKG_NLS
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
           Language Support, also known as internationalization (or i18n)
           support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are: 0 and 1
           (default).

LIMITATIONS
       Anything that is not parsed by Dpkg::Changelog is lost during the
       merge.  This might include stuff like comments which were not supposed
       to be there, etc.

INTEGRATION WITH GIT
       If you want to use this program to merge Debian changelog files in a
       git repository, you have first to register a new merge driver in
       .git/config or ~/.gitconfig:

        [merge "dpkg-mergechangelogs"]
           name = debian/changelog merge driver
           driver = dpkg-mergechangelogs -m %O %A %B %A

       Then you have to setup the merge attribute for the debian/changelog
       file either in .gitattributes in the repository itself, or in
       .git/info/attributes:

        debian/changelog merge=dpkg-mergechangelogs

1.21.1                            2024-02-23           dpkg-mergechangelogs(1)
